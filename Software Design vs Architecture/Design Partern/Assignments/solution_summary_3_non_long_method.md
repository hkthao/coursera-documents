# Refactoring and Common Anti-Patterns in Software Design

This document outlines refactoring and common anti-patterns (code smells) in software development, their implications, and mitigation.

## Refactoring
**Definition:** Restructuring code without changing external behavior to improve design, readability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Anti-Patterns (Code Smells)
Common responses to recurring problems that are often ineffective.

### 1. Comments
**Description:** Either a complete lack of comments or excessive comments.
**Problem:** No comments hinder understanding; too many comments often indicate poorly designed, non-self-explanatory code.
**Suggested Fix:** Improve code clarity, cohesion, and naming to reduce the need for excessive comments.

### 2. Duplicated Code
**Description:** Identical or highly similar code blocks in multiple locations.
**Problem:** Inefficient and error-prone maintenance; changes or bug fixes must be replicated everywhere, increasing risk of inconsistencies.
**Suggested Fix:** Refactor to remove duplication, e.g., by extracting common logic into a shared function or class.

### 3. Large Class (God Class / Blob Class)
**Description:** A class encapsulating too much functionality or too many responsibilities.
**Problem:** Violates separation of concerns, leading to low cohesion; difficult to understand, test, and maintain.
**Suggested Fix:** Apply separation of concerns by breaking the large class into smaller, more focused classes.
