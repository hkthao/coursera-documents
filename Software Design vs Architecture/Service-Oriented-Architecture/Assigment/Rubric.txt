Does the learner appear to have randomly generated a number to use as their index? 

0 points
No, the learner used the default value, INDEX = “uniqueindex”

1 point
Yes, the index appears to be random.

Has the learner implemented a GetBidListTask() method in the ElasticSearchManager class?

0 points
No, either it is not implemented, or clearly it is incorrect. 

1 point
Yes, and it looks like it will work (it is analogous to GetItemListTask() and GetUserListTask())

Has the learner implemented a AddBidTask() method in the ElasticSearchManager class?

0 points
No, either it is not implemented, or clearly it is incorrect. 

1 point
Yes, and it looks like it will work (it is analogous to AddItemTask() and AddUserTask())

Has the learner implemented a RemoveBidTask() method in the ElasticSearchManager class?

0 points
No, either it is not implemented, or clearly it is incorrect. 

1 point
Yes, and it looks like it will work (it is analogous to RemoveItemTask() and RemoveUserTask())

Has the learner modified the AddBidCommand class to save the bid remotely rather than locally?

0 points
No, either it is not changed, or it is clearly incorrect.

1 point
Yes, and it looks like it will work (it is analogous to AddItemCommand and AddUserCommand).

Has the learner modified the DeleteBidCommand class to save the bid remotely rather than locally?

0 points
No, either it is not changed, or it is clearly incorrect.

1 point
Yes, and it looks like it will work (it is analogous to DeleteItemCommand and DeleteUserCommand).

Has the learner added a getRemoteBids() method to the BidList class?

0 points
No, either it has not been implemented, or it is clearly incorrect.

1 point
Yes, and it looks like it will work (it is analogous to ItemList’s getRemoteItems() and UserList’s getRemoteUsers() method).


Has the learner removed the loadBids() method from the BidList class?

0 points
No, the method is still there. 

1 point
Yes, the loadBids() method has been removed.

Has the learner added a getRemoteBids() method to the BidListController class?

0 points
No, either it has not been implemented, or it is clearly incorrect.

1 point
Yes, and it looks like it will work (it is analogous to ItemListController’s getRemoteItems() and UserListController’s getRemoteUsers() method).

Has the learner removed the loadBids() method from the BidListController class?

0 points
No, the method is still there. 

1 point
Yes, the loadBids() method has been removed.

Has the addBid() method in the BidListController class been modified to take in only the required number of arguments? (i.e. bid_list and context are no longer passed in as arguments to these methods).

0 points
No, some or all of these methods still take bid_list and/or context as an argument.

1 point
Yes, these methods have been modified to take in only the required number of arguments. 

Has the removeBid() method in the BidListController class been modified to take in only the required number of arguments? (i.e. bid_list and context are no longer passed in as arguments to these methods).

Has the removeItemBids() method in the BidListController class been modified to take in only the required number of arguments? (i.e. bid_list and context are no longer passed in as arguments to these methods).

0 points
No, some or all of these methods still take bid_list and/or context as an argument.

1 point
Yes, these methods have been modified to take in only the required number of arguments. 

Has the ViewItemActivity view been modified to use the BidListController’s getRemoteBids() method?

0 points
No, the loadBids() method is still called. 

1 point
Yes, ViewItemActivity now calls the BidListController’s getRemoteBids() method instead of the loadBids() method. 

Has the ViewItemBidsActivity view been modified to use the BidListController’s getRemoteBids() method?

0 points
No, the loadBids() method is still called. 

1 point
Yes, ViewItemBidsActivity now calls the BidListController’s getRemoteBids() method instead of the loadBids() method. 

Has the ItemFragmentAdapter been modified to use the BidListController’s getRemoteBids() method?

0 points
No, the loadBids() method is still called. 

1 point
Yes, ItemFragmentAdapter now calls the BidListController’s getRemoteBids() method instead of the loadBids() method.
