How to create your assignment

The provided code base already allows you to store and access both user and item data remotely using Elasticsearch. In this assignment, you will modify the code to implement remote data storage and access for bids.

To accomplish this, you will find it useful to study how Elasticsearch has been implemented for items and users.

Specifically, you will need to implement the following methods in the ElasticSearchManager class:

RemoveBidTask() - Delete bid from remote server using bid_id

AddBidTask() - Add bid to remote server

GetBidListTask() - Returns all remote bids from server

Modify the command classes:

AddBidCommand

DeleteBidCommand

Modify the BidList class:

Add getRemoteBids()

Remove loadBids()

Modify the following methods in the BidListController class

addBid()

removeBid()

removeItemBids() 

Add getRemoteBids()

Remove loadBids()

Finally, you will modify the following views and adapter: 

ViewItemActivity

ViewItemBidsActivity

ItemFragmentAdapter

Before running the code, you must change the value of INDEX in the ElasticSearchManager. You will lose marks if you fail to do this.

public class ElasticSearchManager {
   private static final String SERVER = "http://34.202.206.222:8080";
   private static final String INDEX = "uniqueindex";   // TODO: MUST CHANGE
   // THIS to random number string
   private static final String ITEM_TYPE = "items";
   private static final String USER_TYPE = "users";
   private static final String BID_TYPE = "bids";
   //…

You can run the following curl command in your terminal to select a random number to use as an index.

curl '
https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&min=1000000&max=1000000000&col=1&base=10&format=plain&rnd=new
'

Note: If you do not already have curl, you may download it from your terminal as follows:

Linux users: sudo apt-get install curl

Mac users: brew install curl

Windows users: please follow this tutorial 
https://develop.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001068567-Installing-and-using-cURL#curl_win

After you have run this command, edit your index value correspondingly. In the end, you will have something like:

INDEX = “565706608”

Do not use this above value -- is is for illustrative purposes only. Again, your index must be unique. You will lose marks if you fail to do this. If you use the same index as another learner you will be able to add, edit, and delete another learner’s data, which would make debugging your code a nightmare.

If you are unable to install curl, you may alternatively visit 
https://www.random.org/ 
in a web browser to generate a random number. The site provides a graphical random number generator. Use min = 1000000, max = 100000000.


Hint: Read the comments near the top of the ElasticSearchManager file to learn how to view and delete server contents for your index by running a command in your terminal. For debugging purposes, it will be useful for you to be able to delete all the items, users, and bids stored remotely. Additionally, it may be helpful to view the server contents.
